# Laravel Course Notes
Those are course notes that I took while I learn with [Coder's Tape videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI-Ym2rLZx52vEoqlPQMdg/videos).

This a personal repo and it's unlike that you'll find something useful in this repo.

This repo's purpose is having a proof for other people that I practiced whith laravel and a way to measure how much, so basically this is for pontential employers.

## TutorialsPoint

WHY?

------

## Coder's Tape
The Coder's Tape folder contains two more folders, the 'Beginner 7' for the beginner course of Laravel 6 and the 'Advanced 6' for the advance one plus the 'New in Laravel 7', [I recommend the Coder's Tape videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI-Ym2rLZx52vEoqlPQMdg/videos).

I'll use some parts of these folders for futures projects, like the stubs or some view like app.blade.php, and for reference I use the way is made the seeders and factories.

## Pusher
The pusher folder is for the project showed [here](https://blog.pusher.com/laravel-mvc-use/).

## Note
This is only for testing or experimenting with Laravel, ~~that's why the commits messages are barely helpful, check out [Trivrr](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Trivrr) instead for 'good' commits that I usually write when doing a project.~~
