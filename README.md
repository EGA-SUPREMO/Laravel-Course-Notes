# Laravel Course Notes
Those are course notes that I took while I learn by TutorialsPoint, I don't know if that's a good website but is there something better then open an issue and let me know!

The pusher folder is for the project showed here: https://blog.pusher.com/laravel-mvc-use/

This is only for testing or experimenting that why the commits messages are barely helpful, check out [Trivrr](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Trivrr) instead for 'good' commits that I usually write when I doing a project.
